This project follows consistent, review-friendly engineering  so collaboration stays fast and safe.

1) Branching Rules

| Rule | Why it matters | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Do not push directly to main | Protects stable branch from accidental breaks | Work on feature/auth-backend, then open PR |
| One branch per focused task | Keeps changes reviewable and easier to revert | bugfix/auth-refresh-bug, docs/setup-guide |
| Keep branch names readable | Helps team understand purpose quickly | feature/scan-ui, chore/deps-update |
| Rebase or sync before opening PR | Reduces merge conflicts and CI surprises | Pull latest main, then re-run tests |

Recommended branch patterns:

feature/
bugfix/
hotfix/
chore/
docs/
refactor/
test/
Branch naming examples:

feature/auth-backend
bugfix/client-router-build
2) Commit Message Standards

Commit format: `type(scope): subject`

Examples:

feat(auth): add refresh token rotation endpoint
fix(scans): handle null platform field in results
docs(readme): update local setup steps for ml-service
Commit type table

| Type | Use when | Good example | Avoid |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| feat | New user-facing or API functionality | feat(assets): add upload endpoint template | feat: stuff |
| fix | Bug fix or regression fix | fix(auth): reject expired refresh tokens | fix bug |
| chore | Maintenance work not affecting product behavior directly | chore(repo): restructure server folders | update files |
| docs | Documentation only changes | docs(contributing): add PR checklist | docs: changes |
| refactor | Code restructuring without behavior change | refactor(routes): split auth and user routers | refactor all |
| test | Add or improve tests | test(matching): add hamming threshold cases | tests |
| ci | CI/CD workflow updates | ci(actions): run lint on pull_request | ci update |
| build | Build system or dependency tooling updates | build(client): pin axios to 1.14.0 | npm stuff |
| perf | Performance optimization | perf(analytics): memoize aggregation pipeline | perf tweaks |
| style | Formatting or style-only updates | style(server): normalize semicolons | formatting |
| revert | Revert a previous commit | revert(auth): revert token cookie change | undo |
Commit writing rules

| Rule | Do | Do not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use present tense | add, fix, update, remove | added, fixed, updated |
| Keep subject short | 50-72 chars preferred | Very long paragraph-style subject |
| Keep one intent per commit | Separate docs and backend logic commits | Mix unrelated changes in one commit |
| Use meaningful scope | auth, scans, ml-service, analytics | misc, temp, random |
| Explain breaking changes in body | Mention migration steps if needed | Hide breaking behavior in subject only |
Optional body template for non-trivial commits
Why:

What problem is solved?
What:

What changed technically?
Risk:

Any side effects, migration steps, or rollout notes?
3) Clean Pull Request Standards
PR quality checklist

| Category | Minimum standard |
| --- | --- |
| Scope | PR solves one clear problem |
| Size | Prefer small-to-medium PRs; split very large work |
| Description | Include context, approach, and test evidence |
| Testing | Local checks pass; mention what was run |
| Security | No secrets, tokens, private keys, or env files |
| Compatibility | Mention breaking changes and migration steps |
| Reviewability | Include screenshots/logs for UI or behavior changes |
PR title conventions
Good title	Why good
feat(auth): add register and login route templates	Specific and scoped
fix(client): resolve missing react-router-dom build error	States exact issue and fix
docs(contributing): add commit and PR standards	Clearly docs-only
PR description template
Summary
Short explanation of what changed.
Problem
What issue or gap this PR addresses.
Solution
Key implementation decisions.
Testing
Commands run and outcome.
Risk and Rollback
Known risk and how to revert safely.
Screenshots (if UI)
Before/after visuals.
4) Issue Reporting Best Practices
Issue quality checklist

| Field | What to include | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Title | Clear outcome or bug statement | Scan status stays queued forever |
| Type | bug, feature, chore, docs, security | bug |
| Context | Where and when issue appears | During Phase 3 scan polling |
| Steps to reproduce | Numbered deterministic steps | 1) Start scan 2) Refresh page 3) Status never updates |
| Expected vs actual | Explicit comparison | Expected completed, got queued |
| Impact | Severity and affected users | Blocks demo flow |
| Evidence | Logs, screenshots, payload snippets | Backend log + API response |
| Definition of done | Acceptance criteria | Status transitions and retries work |
Priority and severity guide
Label	Meaning	Typical response
P0-critical	Security/data-loss/outage	Immediate fix
P1-high	Core feature broken	Same day
P2-medium	Important but workaround exists	Planned in sprint
P3-low	Nice to have or minor polish	Backlog
Issue examples
Good bug issue title:

Bug: GET /api/scans/:id/status never reaches completed for failed scraper retries
Good feature issue title:

Feature: Add confidence explainability panel in violations evidence modal
5) Review and Merge Policy
Rule	Requirement
Reviewer count	At least 1 teammate approval
CI status	All required checks green
Conflicts	Must be resolved before merge
Merge style	Squash merge preferred for clean history
Post-merge	Delete merged branch
6) Security and Hygiene Rules
| Rule | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Never commit secrets | Use env templates only (.env.example) |
| Keep lock files committed | Preserve reproducible installs |
| Keep .gitignore updated | Prevent accidental generated file commits |
| Validate before PR | Run lint/build/tests relevant to your change |

Example B: Fix runtime bug

Branch: bugfix/client-router-dependency
Commit: fix(client): install missing react-router-dom dependency
PR title: fix(client): resolve production build failure from unresolved router import
Example C: Maintenance cleanup

Branch: chore/server-model-cleanup
Commit: chore(server): remove duplicate user model file
PR title: chore(server): keep organization model as canonical source
